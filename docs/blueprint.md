# **App Name**: Emberglow Hub

## Core Features:

- Cinematic Hero: Implement a full-screen, interactive hero section with parallax scrolling, incorporating floating ruins, embers, and the mystical flame icon. Animations enhance the immersive experience.
- Ecosystem Showcase: Design a modular card system for apps/tools (Emberlyn Bot, Artist Hub, etc.). Include hover interactions for descriptions and 'Coming Soon' badges, optimized for scalability.
- Community Gallery: Establish a curated static gallery for user-generated content (art, cosplay, music, RP), emphasizing a clean layout with interactive hover effects to highlight content without overwhelming the design.
- Lore Storytelling: Craft an immersive lore section detailing the Eternal Queen, Eternal King, High Council, Wardens, and Citizens using a scrollable or accordion layout. Background fantasy visuals complement the narrative.
- Events Carousel: Develop an event and news section as a carousel, dynamically displaying tournaments, art contests, role-playing events, and site updates.
- Discord Bot Integration (AI-Powered Assistant): Integrate an AI-powered bot using LLM. The bot should act as a tool, answering basic questions, guiding users to relevant sections of the website, and providing lore snippets. The bot should have extensive control and access over almost any topic, but only uses that access when reasoning allows it to improve the answer or guide the user's experience.
- Realm Signups: Newsletter sign-up with prominent callouts for app/product announcements and early access opportunities. Focus on collecting email addresses and not other information.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Crimson Flame (#E63946) to evoke a sense of fantasy and power. Inspired by the imagery of mystical flames and the intensity of the DLS world, this vibrant hue captures attention and symbolizes the creative spark within the ecosystem.
- Background color: Deep Black (#0D0D0D) provides a stark contrast and enhances the depth of the design, reflecting the mysterious and dark fantasy elements of the realm.
- Accent color: Royal Gold (#FFD700) serves as a luxurious highlight for key interactive elements, aligning with the regal aesthetic and drawing focus to essential calls to action. It conveys prestige and importance, enhancing the user's engagement with critical functions.
- Headings: 'Literata' serif font, creating a gothic/serif headline style for titles.
- Body: 'PT Sans' sans-serif font for body content, ensuring readability and a clean, modern contrast to gothic headers.
- Design custom icons that resonate with dark fantasy, and use fire for all flame icons to follow the royal gold branding from above.
- Implement a responsive design ensuring adaptability across various devices; utilize a modular approach for content sections, ensuring scalability.
- Use subtle animations to enrich the experience; parallax scrolling in the hero and lore, glow effects, and floating particles enhance immersion.
